My duplex is in Culver City, a safe residential area with loads of restaurants and public transportation a stroll away. I'm near major connectors and surface streets in West LA and close to Culver City's Expo Rail Station, which connects to Santa Monica, downtown, Hollywood's Walk of Fame, the Convention and Staples centers and major attractions.   Being close to major roads is a bit noisy, but the master bedroom is your exclusive quiet sanctuary, thanks to thick stucco walls. Guests tell me how well they sleep on the queen size pillowtop bed under the Hungarian goose down duvet. For guests who wish separate beds, I put a privacy screen in the living room and inflate my double thick queen air mattress. I charge $25 for the extra service.

Fort Greene is a beautiful and quiet residential area that's still full of interesting restaurants, quaint coffee shops, hip bars, and is incredibly accessible to the rest of NYC (it's a short walk to almost every subway line). The apartment itself is a spacious studio with plenty of room to accommodate 1 or 2 people as they explore one of the best cities in the world! The space is an entire studio apartment on the ground floor of a prewar building one block from Fort Greene Park. There's a full-sized bed, a kitchen in one corner, a small dining table, seating area, and a full bathroom. I'm happy to meet you upon arrival if that would be helpful, but equally happy to leave you completely to your own devices.
