I just moved to NYC to take a room in this townhouse in September. It's been the best three months ever. The place is perfectly located to subway stops, you can walk to East Village, West Village, Union Square etc and Soho so easily and you've got the FM JZ BD trains incredibly close by. Plus you can wander (or run!) across the Wburg bridge which is lovely. It's a 5 bed house with 3 bedrooms upstairs that have their own entrance. It's two bedrooms downstairs including this one. The room is huge with loads of closet space and a really comfy bed. I built it all myself from IKEA :) I've had an amazing time in this room, it's the best location and hopefully you can enjoy it too. Access to the full apartment (two level townhouse) I'll be in the UK BUT av;2016-06-06;t;t;;2014-11-17;f;2016-06-06;40.72136151583931;-73.9876742612955;Huge room in LES townhouse;Lower East Side;1;80.0;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/779f080f-d365-4440-9dca-04ff62b66cd0.jpg?aki_policy=small;10002;1.0;1.0

Petworth was originally two country estates in Washington County, DC (not part of L’Enfant’s original city) owned by John Tayloe.  The city eventually expanded up to this area, and in the 1880s these two estates were purchased for development.  Seemingly overnight, a neighborhood popped up, with thousands of similar-looking brick rowhouses developed in the 1920s and 1930s.

In my humble opinion, it is better than being directly on the boardwalk which can be a bit loud.   I have a private front and back garden, so you would have your own secluded oasis to escape to.
